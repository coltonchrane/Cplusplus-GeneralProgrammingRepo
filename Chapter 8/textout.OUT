    The first device known to carry out calculations was the 
abacus. The abacus was invented in Asia but was used in 
ancient Babylon, China, and throughout Europe until the 
late middle ages. The abacus uses a system of sliding 
beads in a rack for addition and subtraction. In 1642, 
the French philosopher and mathematician Blaise Pascal 
invented the calculating device called the Pascaline. 
It had eight movable dials on wheels and could calculate 
sums up to eight figures long. Both the abacus and 
Pascaline could perform only addition and subtraction 
operations. Later in the 17th century, 
Gottfried von Leibniz invented a device that was 
able to add, subtract, multiply, and divide.
